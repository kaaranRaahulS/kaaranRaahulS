# Hey, I’m Kaaran 👨‍💻

I’m a **Software Engineer with a strong focus on AI engineering**, passionate about building intelligent systems that actually *work in the real world*, not just demos.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **LLMs, backend systems, and product-ready AI**, where clean engineering meets smart models.

## What I Do

* 🤖 Build **AI-powered applications** using LLMs, agents, and retrieval systems
* 🧠 Experiment with **prompt engineering, model behavior, and multi-model orchestration**
* ⚙️ Design **scalable backend systems** that integrate AI reliably
* 📊 Work with data, APIs, and automation to turn ideas into usable products

I care deeply about **code quality, performance, and system design**, not just making models talk.
